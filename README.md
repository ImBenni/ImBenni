# It's me! Benni! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benni, a front-end hobbyist and video creator for fun. Whenever I have some sparetime, I usually dab into making fun projects. 

## ðŸ›  Skills
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Lua
* Video Editing (Premiere Pro, After Effects)

## ðŸŽ¥ What I'm up to
When I'm not working on a video, you'll likely find me cook up a new project or working on an existing one. I usually work on game development using Lua and just explore what I can create. I enjoy diving into new technologies and finding ways to incorporate them into my projects. 

## ðŸ“¬ Get in Touch
If you want to reach out to me in any way, I have some socials that I sometime use.
